# pajbot2 api
First-party API endpoints are registered under this module. These are API modules that are deemed vital for pajbot2.  
A short description of each endpoint can be found in each submodules `routes.go` file.

## I want to register my own API endpoints
See instructions that I have not yet written but I would like to write.
